He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac. It explores the transportability of knowledge by looking at how the Western tradition of \u201cmental philosophy\u201d was rendered in literary Chinese.\n\nHuifang Ma\nHuifang Ma\nAdjunct Senior Language Lecturer of Chinese\nEmail\nhm68@nyu.edu\nRoom\n906\n Education\nMA, Chinese History\nYunnan Normal University\n\nQuestion: What is the highest degree of Zhong-Lin Lu?\nHelpful Answer:", "id": 80, "input": "", "output": "The highest degree of professor Zhong-Lin Lu is PhD, Physics.", "labels": [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], "len_question": 43, "past_id": 845}, {"instruction": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac. It explores the transportability of knowledge by looking at how the Western tradition of \u201cmental philosophy\u201d was rendered in literary Chinese.\n\nQuestion: What is the highest degree of Xianzhen Wang?\nHelpful Answer:", "id": 157, "input": "", "output": "Sorry!

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac. It explores the transportability of knowledge by looking at how the Western tradition of \u201cmental philosophy\u201d was rendered in literary Chinese.\n\nJin Gong\nJin Gong\nClinical Assistant Professor of Chinese\nEmail\njg1781@nyu.edu\nJin Gong is a Clinical Assistant Professor of Chinese at NYU Shanghai.

Professor Engle is also the Michael Armellino Professor of Finance at NYU Stern School of Business and was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Economics for his research on the concept of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH).

His ARCH model and its generalizations have become indispensable tools not only for researchers, but also for analysts of financial markets, who use them in asset pricing and in evaluating portfolio risk.
