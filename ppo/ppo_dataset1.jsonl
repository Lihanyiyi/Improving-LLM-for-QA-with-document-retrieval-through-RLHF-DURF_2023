He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac.

His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac. It explores the transportability of knowledge by looking at how the Western tradition of \u201cmental philosophy\u201d was rendered in literary Chinese.\n\nYe Lu\nYe Lu\nLanguage Lecturer of Chinese\nEmail\nyl70@nyu.edu\nRoom\n903\nYe Lu is a Language Lecturer of Chinese at NYU Shanghai.

She received her PhD in Art History from the Pennsylvania State University. Her work focuses broadly on queer subjectivities that formed through cross-cultural consumption between East Asia and the West. Her primary research and teaching areas include visual and material cultures of France and Japan in the nineteenth\u2013twentieth centuries; gender and sexuality studies; queer theory; and history of photography in East Asia. \nDr. Kong\u2019s current book project, Fleshly Japonisme, examines queer potentials of japonisme, or the Western taste for Japan, that catered to middle-class women in Belle Epoque France. Through intermedial analyses of advertisements, paintings, postcards, garments, and literature, the book explores the ways that ideas of Japan helped these women reimagine their bodily pleasures and desires beyond Western bourgeois conventions of femininity. \n Education\nPhD, Art History\nPennsylvania State University\n\nKang, S.

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself.

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac. It explores the transportability of knowledge by looking at how the Western tradition of \u201cmental philosophy\u201d was rendered in literary Chinese.\n\nQuestion: What is the highest degree of Jing Wang?\nHelpful Answer:", "id": 209, "input": "", "output": "The highest degree of professor Jing Wang is PhD, Information and Communication Studies.", "labels": [3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], "len_question": 40, "past_id": 674}, {"instruction": "Use the following pieces of context to answer the question at the end.

He earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied Chinese intellectual and cultural history. Before joining NYU Shanghai, he was a Research Scholar at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (2017\u20132018) and a research fellow at the International Consortium for Research in the Humanities (IKGF), at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (2013\u20132017). \nZhao Lu has a sustained interest in education and travel in traditional China. His recent book, In Pursuit of the Great Peace: Han Dynasty Classicism and the Making of Early Medieval Literati Culture focuses on the so-called Confucian classics in the Han dynasty (205 BCE\u2013220 CE). It demonstrates how the study of the classics perpetuated a culture of travel among the literati and reshaped the intellectual landscape of 2nd century CE China. \nCollaborating with IKGF and the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, Zhao Lu also studies the history of divination as technical knowledge. He has co-authored with Constance A. Cook Stalk Images: A Newly Discovered Alternative to the Book of Changes. From the perspective of history of science and technology, the book shows how people in the 3rd century CE took elements such as the trigrams from the Book of Changes, and used them to develop a divinatory method fundamentally different from the Book of Changes itself. He also works with Michael Lackner as a general editor of the IKGF Handbook Series of Prognostication and Predication in China with Brill Press. \nIn addition, Zhao Lu has studied the translation and transmission of Western knowledge in China during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The product of this interest is an annotated study of the work Xinling xue \u5fc3\u9748\u5b78 (Mental Philosophy) by Yan Yongjing \u984f\u6c38\u4eac.

His dissertation explores how Buddhism, as an imported religion, contributed to the formation of talismanic culture in medieval China.\nMinhao is currently working on a book manuscript based on his dissertation. In the book, by employing both transmitted Buddhist texts and medieval manuscripts from Dunhuang, he reveals how different religious elements, home or foreign, were creatively utilized in the making, using, and understanding of talismans in medieval China.
